Objective: To create a news app that fetches the latest news articles from a third-party news API and displays them on a web page.

Features:
Users can view the latest news articles from various sources.
The app fetches news articles from a third-party news API and displays them as cards.
Each card displays the article's title, description, source, and publication date.
Users can click on a news card to read the full article on the source's website.
Bonus: Deploy your application on free server Netlify OR you can use any of your own choice.

API to use: Third-party News API (https://newsapi.org)

Technologies:
React, Hooks, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Fetch API for making API calls
Axios/Fetch(for fetching data from APIs)
Local storage
GitHub for version control

Instructions:
Create an HTML page with a container for displaying news cards.
Use CSS to style the container and cards.
Use JavaScript to make an API call to the third-party news API to fetch the latest news articles.
Display the results as cards in the container, showing the article's title, description, source, and publication date.
Add an event listener to each news card so that when it is clicked, the user is redirected to the full article on the source's website.
Style the news cards using CSS to make them visually appealing.
Handle any errors that may occur during the API call and display an appropriate error message to the user.
Consider adding pagination or infinite scrolling to load more news articles as the user scrolls down the page.
Provide a search functionality that allows users to search for news articles based on keywords or topics.
Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce the number of API calls (e.g., the store recently fetched news articles in localStorage or use server-side caching).
Note: Make sure to review and comply with the terms and conditions of the chosen third-party news API, including any required attribution or usage limitations.

Note: Make sure you follow complete react life cycle to get familiar with basics.
